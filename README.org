Clone Orgmode headings so they appear in multiple locations, and sync edits between clones.

[[file:IMAGES/output-2020-09-01-15:37:39.gif]]

* Why clones?
Anyone who has made an outline has run into the problem that an entry belongs in two places. For example:
#+begin_src org 
* Animals
** Dogs
** Cats
* Things with four legs that I don’t like very much
** Tables
** Dogs 
#+end_src
Oh no. The Dogs header belongs in two places. Now suppose that the Dogs header contains everything you know about dogs. 

You could handle this with links, so that you have a source Dog header and subsequent headers simply link back to it. I do not like that solution. I want to clone the header so that it appears in different places in an outline, including in different files. When I edit one of these clones, I want the changes to sync to all the other clones automatically. 

Clones are a type of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion][transclusion]], meaning that text from one file appears in another place, with edits synced back to the original source. It is a prominent featuree of Leo Editor, /see/ https://leoeditor.com/tutorial-pim.html, which I wish I could use but it’s not in Emacs so it is dead to me.

My use case is that I maintain one org file with ongoing research. This file is full of well-written and researched academic work, half-thoughts, notes, links, etc. Sometimes I need to use that research in a paper I am writing. When I do so, I inevitably edit and expand (or contract) the work I have already done. I want this new work—even though it is being written in a different file—to be synced back to my source research file. Before now, there did not appear to be a good and simply way to do this. 

I do not use [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]] or any other package involving the Zettlekasten, or other, note taking method. My brain is simple. I like outlines and only outlines. Anything beyond a simple outline results in diministed productivity.

* Terminology
I use the following teminology in the package:

- Node :: an entry in an org outline
- Headline :: the headline text of the node, but does not include the headline's todo state or tags
- Body :: everything after the headline, planning line, and property drawers until the next node

* Basics
1. Only the headline and body of a node are cloned.
2. Tags, TODO states, priorities, planning lines, property drawers, logbooks, and closing note logs, are not cloned and remain independent. You can change these properties on an individual basis without affecting any clones. (See [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/legalnonsense/org-clones/master/IMAGES/output-2020-09-01-15%3A15%3A40.gif][here]] for a demonstration in a "busy" file.)
3. Anything in the body of a clone (e.g., text, source blocks, tabes, etc.) will be cloned. Only the items listed above aree ignored. 
4. Child nodes of clones are not cloned. Only the node itself is cloned. If you want the children to be cloned, you must clone them separately. 
5. Clones can be reordered, promoted, demoted, and appear anywhere in an org outline or in a different org file. All that matters is that =org-id= can find it.

* Installation
There are no outside dependencies. Place =org-clones.el= in your load path and =(require 'org-clones)=. You can then activate =(org-clones-mode)=. If you create a clone without turning on the mode first, =org-clones-mode= will be enabled automatically. 

In the alternative, this use-package declaration includes all customizable variables, commands, faces, and my own keymap, which you can easily customize:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (use-package org-clones
    :hook
    ;; Note: `org-clones-mode' will only activate
    ;; `cursor-sensor-mode' if there are cursor-sensor-properties
    ;; in the buffer.  Therefore, you can safely add `org-clones-mode'
    ;; to `orgmode-hook' even if you don't plan to use it in every file. 
    (orgmode . org-clones-mode)
    :custom
    (org-clones-commit-edit-shortcut "C-c C-c")
    (org-clones-abort-edit-shortcut  "C-c C-k")
    (org-clones-start-edit-shortcut  "C-c C-c")
    (org-clones-jump-to-next-clone-shortcut "n")
    (org-clones-clone-prefix-icon "◈ ")
    (org-clones-empty-body-string "[empty clone body]")
    (org-clones-empty-headling-string "[empty clone headline]")
    (org-clones-prompt-before-syncing nil)
    (org-clones-use-popup-prompt nil)
    :custom-face
    (org-clones-current-clone ((t (:background "orchid" :foreground "black"))))
    (org-clones-clone ((t (:background "black"))))
    :bind
    (("C-; C-c C-m" . org-clones-store-marker)
     ("C-; C-c C-c" . org-clones-create-clone-dwim)
     ("C-; C-c C-d" . org-clones-delete-this-clone)
     ("C-; C-c C-j" . org-clones-jump-to-clones)
     ("C-; C-c C-u" . org-clones-unclone-this-clone)))
#+end_src

* Usage
** Clone creation
1. Put the cursor at the place you want to create a heading, run =org-clones-create-clone=, which will prompt the user to select a source node with =(org-goto)= and create a new heading at point.
2. Run =org-clones-store-marker=, then place the point at a new location (which can be a different org file) and run =org-clones-create-clone-from-marker=.
3. Run =org-clones-create-clone-dwim= creates a clone from a stored marker if there is one, and otherwise prompts the user for the source.
** Display 
Clones are marked by placing an icon in front of the clone’s headline. This icon can be customized by changing =org-clones-clone-prefix-icon=. The headline and body of a cloned node receive the =org-clones-clone= face. 

When the cursor moves into the headline or body of a cloned node, an overlay is applied which includes the face =org-clones-current-clone=. At that point, the text in that field becomes read-only, and the user must press =C-c C-c= to begin to edit the clone. (=C-c C-c= continues to work in the usual orgmode way so long as the cursor is not inside a headline field.)
** Viewing clones
To cycle through clones of the current node, run =org-clones-jump-to-clones=. Then, press =n= to jump from one clone to another in a loop. Exit with =C-g= or any other key. 
** Editing clones
1. When the cursor enters a cloned headline or body, the text becomes read only. To edit the text, type =C-c C-c=.
2. To complete an edit, type =C-c C-c= again. To discard the edit, type =C-c C-k=.
3. After the edit is completed, all clones will be updated automatically. (If you want an additional prompt before syncing, set =org-clones-prompt-before-sync= to non-nil.)
** Uncloning a clone
If you do not want a clone to be synced, run =org-clones-unclone-this-clone=. The node's ID will removed from all other clones, and the node's =:ORG-CLONES:= property will be set to nil. The node will not otherwise be affected. 
** Caveats
1. =Org-clones= does not (currently) check for conflicts before syncing clones. Sync at your own risk. 
2. =Org-clones= relies on =cursor-sensor-mode=. I have not profiled to see what type of slowdown one might experience in a large file due to =cursor-sensor-mode=. My files are not large enough for this to be a concern.
3. =Org-clones= currently relies on =org-id=. =Org-id= sometimes has problems finding the location of an id, especially in a file that has just been created. Before you blame =org-clones= for a clone not syncing, make sure the file you are using appears in =org-id-locations=. Make use of =org-id-update-id-locations= if you must. You can test whether =org-id= is working as it should by manually trying =(org-id-goto "INSERT ID HERE")=. If that does not work, =org-clones= will not work. I find that saving the file and creating a few ids with =(org-id-get-create)= in some dummy headers, and re-saving the file, eventually solves the problem. (I have used =org-id= for years before noticing this issue and only discovered it when testing this package. Perhaps you will not encouter it.)
4. If =org-clones= cannot find a clone, it does not remove the clone from the clone list automatically (due to the issues with =org-id=, supra, or other issues involving multiple files/computers).
5. If you try to create a new node while editing the body of a clone, you are asking for trouble. =Org-clones= will be confused, and make a mess of everything. I will figure out a good way to prevent this in the future. For now, don't do it.

| =org-clones-prompt-before-syncing=       | Do you want an extra warning before syncing clones?                                                           | nil                      |
| =org-clones-use-popup-prompt=            | If you do want an extra warning, do you want it in the minibuffer (default) or a pop up window?               | nil                      |
** Commands
=Org-clones= provides the following interactive commands:
| Command                             | Effect                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =org-clones-create-clone=             | Create a clone of the node at point, directly below the current node.                                  |
| =org-clones-store-marker=             | Store the current mode to create a clone in a different place                                          |
| =org-clones-create-clone-from-marker= | After storing a node with =org-clones-store-marker=, create a clone of that node at point                |
| =org-clones-create-clone-dwim=        | Create a clone from the stored marker if one is stored; otherwise, prompt the user for the source node |

* How it works
- Clones are tracked via the Orgmode property =:ORG-CLONES:= which contains a list of IDs which correspond to other cloned nodes. 
- A cursor-sensor-function property is placed on each headline and body of each node. 
- When the cursor enters that field, =org-clones= places a transient overlay over the field to alert the user that they are on a cloned node. 
- =Org-clones= also makes the field read-only. This prevents inadvertent edits. Because clones only become read-only when the cursor is within the field, you can still kill and yank headlines, etc., without running into issues with the text being read only. 
- The transient overlay has a keymap which uses =org-clones-start-edit-shortcut=, bound to =C-c C-c= by default. 
- Once the edit mode is invoked, the read-only text property is removed, the header-line appears to remind the user they are editing a clone and showing the shortcuts to commit or abandon the edit. These shortcuts are set with =org-clones-start-edit-shortcut= (=C-c C-c= by default) and =org-clones-abort-edit-shortcut= (=C-c C-k= by default).  
- When the user terminates the edit, the read-only text properties are replaced, the header-line is reset to its previous value, and the transient overlay is replaced. Other variables (recording the state of the node before the edit, etc.) are reset to nil). If the user has committed the edit, all other clones are synced automatically.
- When the cursor exits a cloned field without edits, the transient overlay (and its read-only property) is removed.
